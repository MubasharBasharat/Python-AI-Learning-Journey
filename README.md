# AI-ML-Engineer-Learning-Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step journey to become an **AI/ML Engineer**. Starting from Python basics, Iâ€™m progressing through AI concepts, model handling, and deploying AI models into mobile applications like Flutter.

This is not just code practice â€” itâ€™s my personal **roadmap to becoming an AI/ML Engineer**.
